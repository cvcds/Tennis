My neighbour a young boy plays tennis.
That reminds me of the day's, i used to play..

You need to get your body and mind ready for the game even before you start
Whats more important is that you enjoy the game in the entire process.

I love the classical style grasscourt tennis the most.
Even though the clay court is interesting but grass is classic.
